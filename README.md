# Tab Kit 2

This project aims to make the original [Tab Kit(TK)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/tab-kit/) Pale Moon compatible. 


## Firefox Support Is Gone, Welcome Pale Moon
Since Firefox 57+ only supports their new kind of extension ("WebExtensions"), supporting it would require a complete rewrite.  
With the time (I got a day job) and the knowledge (WebExtensions is completely different in code layout, functionality support) I have,  
I decide to switch to support Pale Moon. It supports XUL extensions (the "old" extension type) like DownThemAll forever.

You have several altermatives here:
- Pale Moon with Tab Kit 2 (download from below, don't use the Firefox one!)
- Vivaldi (Chromium based browser with vertical tab + another kind of tab grouping)
- Firefox with another extension with tab tree support

I am using Pale Moon + Vivaldi myself.


## Description from original Tab Kit (modified)
Tab Kit makes tabs more efficient for power users, allowing a wide variety of tweaks, all of which are optional, notably:

- Group tabs, by domain or opener (parent) tab, manually or automatically
- Vertical tab tree (with splitter), like Tree Style Tab
- Multi-row tabs
- Sort tabs, by address, last loaded, last viewed, order of creation, origin or title
- Control new tab position and close order
- Easily duplicate tabs and groups and copy/move them between windows by dragging
- Scrollwheel tab switch (Extracted to [Tab Kit - Mouse Gestures](https://github.com/tabkit/mouse-gestures))
- 'Mouse rocker' to go back/forward in history (Extracted to [Tab Kit - Mouse Gestures](https://github.com/tabkit/mouse-gestures))
- Highlight unread tabs (and emphasise current tab) (Extracted to [Tab Kit - Tab Highlighter](https://github.com/tabkit/tab-highlighter))
- Scrollbar instead of scroll arrows in over-long Bookmarks and All Tabs popups
- Open Selected Links feature
- Switch tabs on hover (Extracted to [Tab Kit - Mouse Gestures](https://github.com/tabkit/mouse-gestures))
- Options for urls, searches and/or bookmarks to open in new tabs by default
